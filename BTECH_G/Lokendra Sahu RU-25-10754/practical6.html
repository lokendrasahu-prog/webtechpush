        <p>A natural disaster is a catastrophic event that occurs due to natural processes of the Earth. <br>
            These events can lead to loss of life, destruction of property, and significant economic impacts.<BR>
             They are typically classified based on their causes, which can be weather-related, geological, or biological.
